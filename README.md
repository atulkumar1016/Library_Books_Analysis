# Library_Books_Analysis
Excited to share my Library Books Visualization Dashboard built in Excel! 📚📊 It includes genre &amp; publisher analysis, book search, shelf visualization, review-based rankings, and formatted receipts. A great hands-on project applying data cleaning, analysis &amp; dashboard design skills! ✨  #LibraryAnalytics  #DataVisualization  #ExcelSkills
